Classical cryptography refers to encryption methods that are no longer in use today because they are no longer secure. Modern cryptography refers to encryption methods that are currently in use. The division between classical and modern is a little disputed among the professionals but the primary force between the two is the invention of the computer. The classical methods were strong enough to withstand attacks by humans but are easily broken with high-speed computers, hence the reason they are not in use today.
